## What is AtroPM?
AtroPM is a simple but powerful configurable open-source Project Management solution, inspired by Github and Gitlab Project Management, which is based on the [AtroCore](https://github.com/atrocore/atrocore) software platform. AtroPM (as well as AtroCore) is distributed under GPLv3 License and is free. It has a lot of features right out-of-the-box and thus is an excellent tool for managing any kind of projects.

AtroPM is a single page application (SPA) with an API-centric and service-oriented architecture (SOA). It has a flexible data model based on entities and relations of all kinds among them.  

## Why have we developed our own solution?
Yes, there are many other open-source solutions on the market. But most of them are complicated and are not flexible at all. If you are not happy with the processes,  structures and layouts you need to choose some other solution, but it still does not guarantee, that you will be happy with it. By using our solution, you can configure it exactly how you want to have it. Moreover, you can implement any processes, regardless of the complexity of your projects.
